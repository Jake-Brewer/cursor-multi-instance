## Registration Process

1. Agents must register here before performing work
2. Update your "Last Seen" timestamp regularly
3. When locking files, use your prefix in the format: `<!-- LOCKED:[PREFIX]:[TIMESTAMP]:[EXPIRES] -->`
4. Locks expire after 5 minutes or with the next git commit
5. Never edit files locked by another agent unless the lock is expired
