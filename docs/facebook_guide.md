# How to Download Your Facebook Data

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for downloading a complete copy of your personal data from Facebook. Since Facebook does not provide an automated way to do this for personal accounts, you must perform these steps manually through their website.

## Instructions

1. **Navigate to the Correct Page**:
    * Click this link to go directly to the "Download Your Information" page: [https://www.facebook.com/dyi/](https://www.facebook.com/dyi/)
    * You may need to log in to your Facebook account.

2. **Request Your Download**:
    * On the "Download Your Information" page, you will be prompted to select the information you want to download. To get a complete archive, ensure all categories are selected.
    * Crucially, you must select **JSON** as the format for your data. This allows our tool to process it correctly.
    * For **Media Quality**, select **High** to ensure your photos and videos are downloaded in the best possible resolution.
    * For the **Date Range**, select **All time**.

3. **Create the File**:
    * Click the **"Request a download"** button. Facebook will begin preparing your file. This process can take several hours or even days, depending on the amount of data in your account.
    * You will receive an email and a notification on Facebook when your download is ready.

4. **Download and Place the File**:
    * Once notified, return to the "Download Your Information" page and go to the "Available files" tab.
    * Click **"Download"** and save the ZIP file to your computer.
    * To allow this application to process your data, place the entire, unzipped folder into the `input/facebook/` directory within this project. If these directories do not exist, please create them.
