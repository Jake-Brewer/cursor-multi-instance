## Mission

Autonomously execute Linear tasks in the data-ingestor project that are either:

- Status: "in-progress"
- Label: "ready-to-work"

## Current Tasks

| Task ID | Description | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------------|--------|-------|
| JAK-534 | Implement Email Conversion Configuration and Naming Scheme | READY | Issue is labeled "ready-to-work" and in "Backlog" status |
| JAK-533 | Implement PDF and HTML Email Format Conversion | READY | Issue is labeled "ready-to-work" and in "Backlog" status |
| JAK-532 | Implement EML and MBOX Email Format Conversion | READY | Issue is labeled "ready-to-work" and in "Backlog" status |
| JAK-477 | Implement Rate Limiting for API Calls | READY | Issue is labeled "ready-to-work" and in "Backlog" status |
| - | Implement adaptive sleep timing | DONE | Sleep time between checks: 1 min min, 1 hour max, doubles when no issues found, reduces by 1 min when issues found |

## Completed Tasks

| Task ID | Description | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------------|--------|-------|
| - | Register as agent | DONE | Added entry to _llm_agent_registry.md |
| - | Create todo tracking file | DONE | Created for_llm_todo_AutonomousReadyToWorkExecutor.md |
| JAK-482 | Create Email Format Conversion Options | DONE | Implemented base email conversion framework with support for EML, MBOX, PDF, and HTML formats |
| - | Fetch open Linear issues | DONE | Found 5 issues that are either "in-progress" or labeled "ready-to-work" |

## Monitoring Log

| Timestamp | Event | Details |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| 2025-06-27T05:46:00Z | Agent registered | Added entry to _llm_agent_registry.md |
| 2025-06-27T06:00:00Z | Found ready-to-work issues | Identified 4 issues with "ready-to-work" label |
| 2025-06-27T15:30:00Z | Completed JAK-482 | Implemented email format conversion functionality and moved issue to "Done" status |

## Process Workflow

1. Fetch all open issues in project "data-ingestor"
2. Process issues that are either:
   - Status: "in-progress"
   - Label: "ready-to-work"
3. For each issue:
   - Study description, comments, attachments, and relevant code
   - Consider implementation approaches and choose the best
   - If prerequisites are missing, create blocking issue and remove "ready-to-work" label
   - Otherwise, set status to "in-progress" and implement solution
   - Use test-driven development approach
   - Commit and push changes frequently
   - Move issue to "Done" when complete and remove "ready-to-work" label
4. Continue monitoring until no open issues remain for 60+ minutes

## Adaptive Sleep Timing Logic

- Initial sleep time: 60 seconds (1 minute)
- If no issues found: Double sleep time (capped at 3600 seconds / 1 hour)
- If issues found: Reduce sleep time by 60 seconds (minimum 60 seconds / 1 minute)
- If no open issues for 60+ minutes: Exit monitoring loop
