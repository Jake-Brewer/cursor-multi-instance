## Monitoring Log

| Timestamp | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| 2025-06-27T05:46:00Z | Started monitoring for ready-to-work issues |

## Process Workflow

1. Fetch all open issues in project "data-ingestor"
2. Process issues that are either:
   - Status: "in-progress"
   - Label: "ready-to-work"
3. For each issue:
   - Study description, comments, attachments, and relevant code
   - Consider implementation approaches and choose the best
   - If prerequisites are missing, create blocking issue and remove "ready-to-work" label
   - Otherwise, set status to "in-progress" and implement solution
   - Use test-driven development approach
   - Commit and push changes frequently
   - Move issue to "Done" when complete and remove "ready-to-work" label
4. Continue monitoring until no open issues remain for 60+ minutes
