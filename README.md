# Multi-Instance Cursor IDE System

A comprehensive management system for running multiple isolated Cursor IDE instances with custom configurations, AI models, and visual themes.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This system enables simultaneous development across 1-10 applications with complete isolation, supporting all phases of software development and business operations including:

- **Task Automation** & Research
- **Business Planning** & Documentation  
- **Contact Management** & CRM
- **Complete SDLC** from planning to deployment
- **Multi-scale Development** (simple scripts to enterprise applications)

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔒 Complete Isolation
- Each Cursor instance runs in complete isolation
- Performance issues in one instance don't affect others
- Separate process spaces and memory management

### 🎨 Visual Identification
- Unique color schemes per instance for easy identification
- Color schemes applied to editor themes, UI, window borders, status bars
- Preset templates plus custom color creation tools

### 🤖 AI Model Configuration
- Different AI models per instance based on workspace purpose
- Support for multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Per-instance API key management and optimization settings

### 📊 Real-Time Monitoring
- Live graphical dashboard showing resource usage across instances
- Monitor CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network usage per instance
- Performance alerts and health status indicators
- Historical usage tracking

### ⚙️ Configuration Management
- Graphical interface for managing workspace configurations
- Template system for common workspace types
- Import/export functionality for sharing configurations
- Git versioning for all configuration changes

### 🚀 Quick Launch System
- Menu/link-based selection interface for launching instances
- One-click launching with predefined configurations
- System tray integration and Windows shell integration

## 📋 Requirements

- Windows 10/11 with 64GB RAM (optimized for high-memory environments)
- Cursor IDE installed
- Git for configuration version control
- Node.js (for the management interface)
